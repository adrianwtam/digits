## Overview
This is a mini project with basic capabilities such as:
- Data Collection/ Display (Mongo)
- Multiple Accounts
- Admin Level Pages/Abilities
- File Reading for Data Extraction
Groups of Data is stored in Collections (which you can invision as classes) and the individual pieces of data is called a Document. This concept is the cornerstone to the whole process. A limiter which only allows certain values and variables is placed on those collections (schema) and these collections are created with no limit to it's capacity. Thus they hold data in a controlled format.
We access different collections for different information and we can also store information as well.
Additionally, Meteor, MiniMongo, ESLint, Semantic UI (React) are all also used.

## Installation
Clone this repo to your computer
Open command prompt on your PC and go into the repository's 'app' folder
Run 'meteor npm install' and then 'meteor npm run start' to start the app.
- If you are on windows you might find that 'meteor npm install' is taking a bit too long. That's alright, just open Command Prompt in Administrator mode.
- Use 'cd /' to go to the root of your storage, Ex: C:/
- Use 'cd (folder name)' without the () to go to the next folder
- Folders with spaces in them cannot be 'cd 'ed to. Beware!

Make sure you are using an IDE with the capability to run ESLint
Editing in an IDE is also convenient because it allows you to edit and get feedback from the website almost instantly

When the 'meteor npm run start' is done booting up, go to 'http://localhost:3000/#/' in your browser to go to the app
